# vue-grid-layout

**WORK IN PROGRESS: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

vue-grid-layout is a grid layout system, like [Gridster](http://gridster.net), for Vue.js.

**Heavily inspired in [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout)**

It's responsive and supports breakpoints. Breakpoint layouts can be provided by the user
or autogenerated.
